# Voronoi-Diagram-Generator
Simple voronoi generator that will produce a ppm image of said diagram.

there are a few tags that are able to be passed in. \
    -? will display the rest of the tags available. \
    -h sets the height of the diagram in pixels.\
    -w sets the width of the diagram in pixels. \
    -s will set the amount of seed pixels. \ 
    -m will set the distance formula to manhattan distance formula. \
    -e will set the distance formula to euclidean distance formula.

program will default to. \
    euclidean distance formula. \
    720 pixel height. \
    720 pixel width. \
    250 seeds.


future implimentations. \
    - update to effiecient algorithm instead of brute force. \
    - allow borders to be calculated between each cell. \
    - more to come..
